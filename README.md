# Getting Started

This is a [**React Native**](https://reactnative.dev) project, bootstrapped using [`@react-native-community/cli`](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli).

>**Note**: Make sure you have completed the [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/0.71/environment-setup) instructions till "Creating a new application" step, before proceeding.

## Step 1: Create the environment file

Create a `.env` file in the root of the project with the content of `.env.example` file. Replace the example values with your own.

```bash

Use [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) to run the following commands:
## Step 1: Start the Metro Server
First, you will need to start **Metro**, the JavaScript _bundler_ that ships _with_ React Native.
To start Metro, run the following command from the _root_ of your React Native project:
```bash
yarn start
```
## Step 2: Start your Application
Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your _Android_ or _iOS_ app:
### For Android
```bash
yarn android
```
### For iOS
```bash
yarn ios
```
If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see the app running in your _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

# Build

## Android

You will need the keystore file to sign your app in release mode. Make sure you have it before going any further.

Add the `my-release-key.keystore` file under the `android/app` directory.

Create a `gradle.properties` file inside `./android/.gradle` with the following content:

```bash
MYAPP_RELEASE_STORE_FILE=my-release-key.keystore
MYAPP_RELEASE_KEY_ALIAS=my-key-alias
MYAPP_RELEASE_STORE_PASSWORD=***** # Password of the keystore file (given while creating the keystore file)
MYAPP_RELEASE_KEY_PASSWORD=***** # Same as store password
```

Generate a release build for Android by running the following command:

```bash
cd android && ./gradlew assembleRelease
```

The generated APK can be found under `android/app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk`, and is ready to be distributed.

## iOS
